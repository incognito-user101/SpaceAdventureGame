# SpaceAdventureGame

Description:
Main player: Astronaut. 
Other objects: aliens, meteorits, spaceshipt parts.
The mission of an Astronaut is to collect the spaceship parts (let's think so..)
Astronaut has to avoid aliens and meteorits.
If main player hits objects to avoid, the score, position of player will be reset to default.
By collecting 10 spaceship parts (score: 10), the level changes (background and name of the planet).
Maximum number of planets: 4 ("Aidala", "Jerdin bir jeri", "Baigaistan", "It olgen jer").
The game doesn't have end score, so enjoy!
